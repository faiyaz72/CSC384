1) See the pitfalls of Manhattan Heuristic, any more constraints you add will likely improve it
2) Focus on avoiding paths that will lead to deadends, like moving the snowball to the edge
3) Try programming the heuristic such that it is attracted first to the Large, then Medium, then Small snowball inorder to build it
4) Somehow take account of obstacles, that your robot must take into account when planning its route
5) Figure out ways that will make your heuristic return early and avoid unnecessary loops as your primary aim is to beat the benchmark rather than solve everything
